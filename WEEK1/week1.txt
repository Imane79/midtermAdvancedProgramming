 print(line)
Preserves all whitespace exactly as it appears in the file

Includes newline characters (\n) at the end of each line

Result: Double-spaced output (because print() adds its own newline to the existing one)

python
Copy
# File content: "Hello\nWorld"
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line) 
# Output:
# Hello
#
# World


 print(line.strip())
Removes leading/trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines)

Eliminates the original newline character from the file

Result: Clean single-spaced output (only print()'s newline remains)

python
Copy
# Same file content
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
# Output:
# Hello
# World
